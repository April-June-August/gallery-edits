# Taking Good Screenshots

Workflow instructions in the Alfred Gallery must include images to complement the text. A great screenshot captures what is essential but not what is extraneous: it presents the Alfred window (but not a wallpaper) and what is available in your workflow (but not other features).

macOS can take screenshots of individual windows, preserving their shadow against a transparent background. Press <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>4</kbd> and your cursor will turn into a crosshair <img src="images/taking-screenshots/icon-crosshair.png" width="24">. Now press <kbd>space</kbd> and it will change into a camera icon <img src="images/taking-screenshots/icon-camera.png" width="24">. Move it over a window and it will get a blue overlay. Click to take the screenshot.

## Unsuitable Examples

<img src="images/taking-screenshots/bad-script-filter.png" width="740">

<img src="images/taking-screenshots/bad-universal-action.png" width="740">

The above screenshots have several issues:

* The wallpaper is visible, making the screenshot look out of place when embedded on a web page.
* Entries from other workflows and macOS are distracting and make it hard to discern what the workflow does.
* Data is disorganised and looks fake, making it difficult to understand its purpose.

## Good Examples

<img src="images/taking-screenshots/good-script-filter.png" width="740">

<img src="images/taking-screenshots/good-universal-action.png" width="740">

In the above:

* Screenshots are clean, capturing only the window and its shadow.
* Actions displayed are exclusive to this particular workflow.
* The data looks real, a true example of what using the workflow might be like.
