## Setup

Turn on `Allow JavaScript from Apple Events` in the browsers you want to control. Use the Help search in the menubar to find it.

## Usage

Pause audio and video in tabs of all open web browsers via the `pause all` keyword. `pause others` does the same except for the current tab. <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>↩</kbd> makes it only pause tabs from the current browser.
