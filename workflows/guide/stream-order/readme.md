The objective of this workflow is to help you understand the order in which objects are processed. 

Before using the workflow keywords, click the "Debug" icon in the top right of the workflow editor, so that the debugger panel appears at the bottom of the window. This will allow you to see each output of each stream.

Type the keyword for each of the sub-workflows to see the order in which objects are processed, and how the delay utility affects the order of actions.
