Append `::` to the configured keyword to access other actions, including opening the [Firefox Profile Manager](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/profile-manager-create-remove-switch-firefox-profiles). Bookmarks are only indexed from the default profile, which can be changed from the Profile Manager in each Firefox build.
