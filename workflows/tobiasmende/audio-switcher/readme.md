## Usage

Switch between audio output devices (like speakers) via the `out` keyword and audio input devices (like microphones) with `in`.

Configure the Hotkeys for faster triggering of up to three input and three output devices or to rotate through favourites.

In the Workflowâ€™s Configuration you can filter out devices that should not show up in the suggestions. To make this easier, the `fetchaudiodevices` keyword can copy names of output or input devices to the clipboard.
